                            In studying the Python programming language for 2 semesters, I made a review/note about the basics of <span class="red">Python</span> including: data types, data structures, conditional statements, operations, modules, functions and others, in the form of a website application that I also made with Python and Streamlit framework. I want this work to be useful for friends, especially those outside the software engineering major who are learning programming languages.

                        <p class="desc">
                            This project is a simple web application built using the Streamlit framework and Pandas library. This application aims to analyze Covid-19 data in Indonesia by utilizing datasets from Kaggle which are then processed and visualized through graphs and tables. The available features are to display the growth of new cases, deaths and recoveries in Indonesia and in each province in Indonesia in the form of a line chart for a certain period. In addition, there are also metrics to display total cases, deaths and recoveries. This project is suitable for use by the general public or parties interested in analyzing Covid-19 data in Indonesia quickly and easily.

                            I updated the appearance of the website SITAMPAN (Sistem Informasi Tagihan Air Pasti Nyaman) of the company where I did my internship pure with HTML, CSS, and JS which was originally only tasked with checking water bills, into an attractive company profile website. But the website has not been officially launched as a company website because updating requires the intervention of the central IT division.

                            I led my cross-major friends in a computational thinking project. We created a container to hold python scripts that are used to solve mathematical solutions especially those that can be applied to STEM material. The background in this project was during a pandemic that required online lessons, I solved math problems more with python code than calculating according to the given formula.
